# Running the website
Since big browsers are still in the work of adopting XR support, we will need to use other browsers that are supporting it.<br />
1. For our case, we will use WebXR Viewer by Modzilla.
2. Make sure to download it on PlayStore or AppStore.
3. Open the browser and visit the website at `https://portal-scene-xr.vercel.app/`.

# Technologies and Features
For this experiment, I focused on achieving the necessary results by using:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (for 3D objects and animation along with raycasting)
 - [WebXR](https://github.com/immersive-web) (for implementing AR and VR experience)
 - [Eruda](https://eruda.liriliri.io/) (for mobile debugging)
 - [Resonance Audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/)
# Credits
This experiment wouldn't be possible without the resources [Three.js Course](https://threejs-journey.com/) and [WebXR Academy](webxracademy.com) has been providing.
